# Colab and Jupyter change formatting and the import names
# I DON'T KNOW WHY THE FIRST IMPORT SAYS "import you"
# I DON'T HAVE A CURSOR IN COLAB

# Five hours and counting: Friday: 3hrs environment fixes, with help
# Saturday: two hours environment fixing and Colab exploring

# This is a test to see if more things change between saving this
# as .py and pushing in kraken
