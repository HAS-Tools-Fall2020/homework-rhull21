My forecast was based on the apparent trend of streamflow
in previous years starting in August and continuing until December.
It looks like flow is at its nadir right now, but gradually
increases to ~ 200 cfs in late Nov and early Dec.

Speculating about process - SW losses to Evapo/Transpiration decrease during cooler months?

## Grade
3/3 - Great job!
